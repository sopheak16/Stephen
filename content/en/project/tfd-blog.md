We often hear the term **vlog** on YouTube nowadays. What about **Blog**?

Blog is a website that regularly updates information concerning specific topics that people who really care and are interested in the topics in question. Blog can be a news website, personal diary, tips, DIY, etc.

So the **V** in front of the blog means **video**. We can say  that vlog is a version of blog that tells stories in video instead of writing.
